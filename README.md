# hello-world
First Repository, First hello-world, and now the first branch.  Reading the Github hello-world step by step.  Found my inspration to take these steps from some great apks that I'd like to learn how to tweak to my liking and then grow from there.  
I found and open-source apk that says it encrpts files under a password, and it seemed like I was looking for at the time, but noticed it had a strange permission.  Not that I doubt the developer had no good reason to include that permission, I figured this would be the perfect time to learn about the GitHub world and see if I can atually go into the programming, cut out the unwanted permission, and then see if the app works for my needs.  In my head it seems simple enoug but since I know nothing abouut open source, or code or programming, etc I am humblled to read and try and learn   Ideally it really is as easy as I mke it out to me and I can move on to contributing to apps I aleady love or possibly build apps from the ground up.
